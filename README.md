This is the implementation of the paper "Iris Template Protection Based on Local Ranking".
The Datasets we used are preprocessed with the open source iris recognition system OSIRIS_v4.1.
Due to copyright protection, we did not put the binary datasets together, you can use the OSIRIS system to convert the image into a binary string by yourself, and then input the binary datasets into our algorithm.
